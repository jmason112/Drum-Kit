<h1>Drum Kit Project Documentation</h1>
<p>This project is a virtual drum kit that allows users to play drum sounds by clicking on buttons or pressing certain keys on their keyboard. It is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The project consists of three main files:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>index.html</strong>: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the drum kit.</li>
<li><strong>styles.css</strong>: The stylesheet that defines the visual appearance of the drum kit.</li>
<li><strong>index.js</strong>: The JavaScript file that adds interactive functionality to the drum kit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Users can interact with the drum kit by clicking on the drum buttons with the mouse or by pressing the corresponding keys on their keyboard.</p>

<h2>HTML File (index.html)</h2>
<p>The HTML file contains a set of buttons each representing a different drum sound. These buttons are styled and made interactive through CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<h2>CSS File (styles.css)</h2>
<p>The CSS file provides styling for the drum buttons and the overall layout of the drum kit. It includes styles for button states such as active or pressed.</p>

<h2>JavaScript File (index.js)</h2>
<p>The JavaScript file adds event listeners to the drum buttons to play sounds when clicked or when the corresponding key is pressed. It also handles visual feedback for button presses.</p>

<h2>Additional Information</h2>
<p>The project is designed to be responsive and user-friendly. It can be extended with additional sounds or visual effects.</p>
